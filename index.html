    <div id="text">Hello! I'm Jovana, a passionate student  who loves creating, exploring, and sharing new ideas. With a keen eye for detail and a heart full of curiosity, I dive into projects that challenge my skills and expand my horizons.

        When I'm not studying, you can find me playing the guitar, exploring the great outdoors and  hanging with my friends. I believe in the power of creativity to transform the ordinary into the extraordinary, and I'm always on the lookout for inspiration in the world around me.

        Here, you'll find a collection of my work, thoughts, and projects. Feel free to explore, get in touch, or simply enjoy the journey with me. Let's create something amazing together!
